- ... *not* just about learning the C++ language

- Why not?

- C++ from the start has been driven by real problems

  - We are software engineers, not computer scientists

- C++ is by nature complicated, due to its underlying goal

  - Control over hardware...
  
  - ... while still having an abstraction layer

- Our goal: to learn C++ as engineering tool

- C++ is an expressive, powerful language

    - Hardware: CPU, memory, Uncore, devices, ...
  
    - Machine code

    - Operating system: scheduler, virtual memory, ...

    - Low level libraries: libc, ld, libatomic, ...

    - C++ STL

    - Core C++ libraries: STL, Boost, QtCore

    - Business level libraries: Ogre, Eigen, SFML, RocksDB, ...
