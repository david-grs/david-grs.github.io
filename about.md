Hi there, I am David Gross, an enthusiastic software developer. 

With this blog, I aim to share some experiments, knowledge or ideas I have about
programming. It will be most of the time around high performance computing: speed critical 
code, high throughput, multi threading. I also use exclusively GNU/Linux.

I work for a fabulous [private trading company](http://www.optiver.com/) since 2014, as 
autotrading developer. Before, I was working few years for the French Ministry of Defence. Both
jobs were different in many ways, but still focus on C++ and performance.

Aside from job, I am a passionate rock climber and philosophy reader &mdash; no worries, I will not
bother you with that here!

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:gdavid.devel@gmail.com) for any comments, suggestions, questions, ...

David
